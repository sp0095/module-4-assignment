        "\n",
        "1. Basic Function Definition You define a function using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.\n",
        "Example:\n",

        "def greet(name): return \"Hello, \" + name\n",

        "print(greet(\"Sharanya\")) # Output: Hello, sharanya\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Function with Default Parameters You can define default values for parameters. If the caller doesn't provide a value for that parameter, the default is used.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(name=\"Guest\"): return \"Hello, \" + name\n",
        "\n",
        "print(greet()) # Output: Hello, Guest print(greet(\"ReX\")) # Output: Hello, ReX\n",

        "\n",
        "Hello, ReX\n",
